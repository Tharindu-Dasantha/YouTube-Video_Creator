 In high school Two kids both named Logan. Both last names were very similar. One was popular and the other was not. Unpopular Logan was drunk and ran across a road in the middle of the night and was killed by a semi-truck. The next day the principle announced that popular Logan had died. Popular Logan was late for school.. Everyone was very sad. Then popular Logan showed up and all school rejoiced that unpopular Logan was the one who died. Was fucked up.
